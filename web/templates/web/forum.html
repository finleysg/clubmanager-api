        <h1>Forum page</h1>
        <p>A forum for announcements, news, questions, etc. Pretty standard stuff - should be able to drop in a canned Django forum app.</p>
        <p>Regular financial updates/documents could be in a sticky, read-only topic here. Otherwise we could dedicate a page for that.</p>
